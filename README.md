# Task -3 

A brief description :

Task-3 is a continuation of Task-1 and 2 so I used the task-1 folder itself(so the code for task-2 and 3 is in the task-1 folder)

 

1.1 Add Jwt auth token in all apis

1.2 Perform data encryption {Optional}


------------------------------------------------------------------

JWT authentication has been implemented for each api. It's required helper functions are imported from the file auth.js.

Data encryption has been performed for the password encryption done with the help of 'bcryptjs' module.
